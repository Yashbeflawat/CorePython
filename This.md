# Function - Definition and Basic Syntax & DRY Principle

## Objective: What is a Function, syntax, and why it is used?

A function is a `block of code which only runs when it is called.`

We can pass data, known as `parameters`, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that enhance `modularity, efficiency, and readability`.

## Basic Syntax to Define a Function

def my_function():
    print("Hello")
