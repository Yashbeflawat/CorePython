# Task 5: Other Data Types - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

## Objective:

### Lists: Ordered, Mutable Collection

A list is an ordered collection of items that is mutable, meaning you can modify its contents after it has been created. Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, and items are separated by commas `,`.

**Example of a list:**
```python
favorite_fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Elderberry"]
```

### Tuples: Ordered, Immutable Collection

A tuple is similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable, which means you cannot change the items once the tuple is created. Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

**Example of a tuple:**
```python
coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # Example coordinates for New York City
```

### Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs

A dictionary is an unordered collection of items, where each item is stored as a pair consisting of a key and a value. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}`, and the key-value pairs are separated by a colon `:`.

**Example of a dictionary:**
```python
# Adding a practical dictionary example since it was missing in the original
student = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 20,
    "grade": "A",
    "courses": ["Math", "Physics", "Computer Science"]
}
```
