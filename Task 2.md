## Understanding Comments

### 1. Single-Line Comment

A single-line comment begins with the `#` character. Any text following the `#` on that line is regarded as a comment.

**Example:**

# This is a single-line comment
y = 20  # This is an inline comment

### 2. Multi-Line Comment
While Python lacks a dedicated syntax for multi-line comments, you can use several single-line comments or employ triple quotes (''' or """) to achieve this.

**Example:**

"""This is a multi-line comment.
It can extend over multiple lines and is useful
for providing comprehensive descriptions."""
y = 20

**Understanding Indentation**
Indentation in Python refers to the use of spaces or tabs at the start of a line of code, which establishes the structure and hierarchy within the code.

**Why Indentation Matters in Python:**
**Defines Code Structure:** Indentation indicates which statements are part of the same block, allowing Python to recognize control structures like loops and conditionals.

**Enhances Readability:** Proper indentation makes the code visually appealing and easier to follow, helping other developers (or your future self) understand the logic quickly.

**Prevents Errors:** Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or unintended behavior in the code, so maintaining consistent indentation helps avoid such pitfalls.

**Indicates Scope:** It helps delineate the scope of functions, classes, and loops, clarifying where a particular block of code begins and ends.
Facilitates Collaboration: In collaborative projects, consistent indentation styles improve teamwork by making the codebase more uniform and easier to navigate for multiple developers
